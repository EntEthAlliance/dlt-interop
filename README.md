# EEA Crosschain Interoperability Public Repository

Welcome to the public Github repository of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Crosschain Interoperability Working Group!

This repository is to enable public review on the work of the [EEA Crosschain Interoperability Working Group](https://entethalliance.github.io/crosschain-interoperability/).

The current focus of the Working Group is the EEA Distributed Ledger Interoperability Specification, which is available for public review and comments from April 15th, 2024 to June 14th, 2024.



## EEA DLT Interoperability Specification


The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) Distributed Ledger Technology Interoperability Specification aims to establish a secure and efficient framework for interoperability between different blockchain networks, focusing on enterprise applications. This specification addresses the need for various blockchain platforms to interact and transact seamlessly, especially in complex and regulated sectors like financial services and supply chain management. The specification includes architectural guidelines, protocol stack, and interfaces definitions, which are crucial for asset and data exchange across different blockchain systems, thereby enhancing their functionality and utility.
</br></br>
It is designed to support enterprise blockchain networks using diverse underlying technologies (for example EVM and non-EVM networks), facilitating complex multi-chain ecosystem deployments involving assets, payments, and securities transactions. The open standard prevents fragmentation across different vendor implementations. Use cases include currency exchanges between blockchains with different tokens, coordinating securities transfers with payment transfers on different chains, and atomic swaps/transfers of assets. The specification aims to support regulated enterprise use cases that require interoperability between multiple blockchains with secure guarantees.  </br></br>


### Public Review Process

The public review process is an integral part of ensuring due process and consensus is achieved in the development of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) standards and guidelines.
We value your input and encourage you to provide feedback on the EEA DLT Interoperability Specification. The public review period is open from April 15th, 2024 to June 14th, 2024. </br>

The draft specification is available: [EEA DLT Interoperability Specification Draft](https://entethalliance.github.io/crosschain-interoperability/draft_dlt-interop_techspec.html).

To participate in the review process, please follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Review the specification document.</li>
<li>Open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker. Be sure to follow the submission rules as per Github issue template</li>
<li></li>
</ol>

Comments should be made by adding a comment to an [open issue](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/dlt-interop/issues) if there is a relevant issue already, or by creating a
[new issue](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/dlt-interop/issues/new/choose). If proposals are editorial in nature (i.e. they clarify wording, fix spelling mistakes or obvious logic errors),
the process is fairly straightforward. If a proposal suggests a substantive change - e.g. adding a new requirement, or changing a requirement so it will be tested differently,
we request the commenter to complete the [EEA Non-member participation agreement](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/Ethtrust-public/blob/main/EEA-Non-Member-Participation-Agreement.pdf). Essentially this is an agreement not to introduce material covered by a "submarine patent",
and to respect any confidential information provided by the group, although that will usually be minimal or none.

When raising an issue, this is handled by the template, but if a comment requires an equivalent commitment,
the agreement MUST be signed or the comment will be quarantined.

The Working Group will consider the issues raised, reply in the public issue as they make progress or request clarification, and explain their resolution and the outcome of each issue.
The group **MAY** invite individuals who have raised issues to participate in a discussion. Any member of EEA is automatically entitled to participate in the Working Group.
