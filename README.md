# EEA DLT-Interop Public Repository

This repository is to enable public comment on the work of the [EEA Crosschain Interoperability Working Group](https://entethalliance.github.io/crosschain-interoperability/).

Comments should be made by adding a comment to an [open issue](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/dlt-interop/issues) if there is a relevant issue already, or by creating a
[new issue](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/dlt-interop/issues/new/choose). If proposals are editorial in nature (i.e. they clarify wording, fix spelling mistakes or obvious logic errors),
the process is fairly straightforward. If a proposal suggests a substantive change - e.g. adding a new requirement, or changing a requirement so it will be tested differently,
we request the commenter to complete the [EEA Non-member participation agreement](https://github.com/EntEthAlliance/Ethtrust-public/blob/main/EEA-Non-Member-Participation-Agreement.pdf). Essentially this is an agreement not to introduce material covered by a "submarine patent",
and to respect any confidential information provided by the group, although that will usually be minimal or none.

When raising an issue, this is handled by the template, but if a comment requires an equivalent commitment,
the agreement MUST be signed or the comment will be quarantined.

The Working Group will consider the issues raised, reply in the public issue as they make progress or request clarification, and explain their resolution and the outcome of each issue.
The group **MAY** invite individuals who have raised issues to participate in a discussion. Any member of EEA is automatically entitled to participate in the Working Group.
